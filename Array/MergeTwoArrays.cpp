Problem #4 : Merge two sorted Arrays
Description : We are given two sorted arrays arr1[ ] and arr2[ ] of size m and n respectively. We have to merge these arrays and store the numbers in arr3[ ] of size m+n.
Input
1 3 4 6
2 5 7 8
Output
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Solution : The idea is to traverse both the arrays simultaneously and compare the current numbers from both the Arrays. Pick the smaller element and copy it to arr3[ ] and advance the current index of the array from where the smaller element is picked. When we reach at the end of one of the arrays, copy the remaining elements of another array to arr3[ ].
Pseudo Code
// input arrays - arr1(size m), arr2(size n)
void merge_sorted(arr1, arr2, m, n)
{
    arr3[m+n] // merged array
    i=0,j=0,k=0
    while(i < m && j < n) 
    {
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j] :
            arr3[k++] = arr1[i++]
        else :
            arr3[k++] = arr2[j++]
    }
    while(i < m)
        arr3[k++] = arr1[i++]
    while(j < n)
        arr3[k++] = arr2[j++]
}
Time Complexity : O(m+n)
Auxiliary Space : O(m+n)
