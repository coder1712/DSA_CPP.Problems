//Point reflection
//given x and y; z = 2y-x; reflection against y
//Pigeonhole Principle: If there are three pigeons and two nests,

//Minimum no. of draws to find a pair of socks from n pair of socks:n-1
//Handshakes in a room with n people = n*(n-1)/2
//No. of digits in a factorial of a number: use: log(a*b) = log(a)+log(b);
// Natural numbers having three divisor are perfect prime square.e.g 4,9,25 (2,3,5)squares of prime numbers.
/*Imp. Mathematics Topics:-
1:No. of digits in a number(N): floor(log10(N)+1) T.C= O(1);
2:Arithmetic Progression:
    nth term:- a+(n-1)d;
    Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP =  (n/2)*(first term + last term) = 0.5*n*[2a + (n-1)d]
3:Geometric Progression:
    nth term of a GP = a*rn-1.
    Geometric Mean = nth root of the product of n terms in the GP.
    Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – rn)] / [1 – r].
    Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (rn – 1)] / [r – 1].
    Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).
4:Quadratic Equation:
    roots = (-b ± √(b2 - 4ac))/2a
    If b2 < 4ac, then roots are complex
    If b2 > 4ac, then roots are real and different
    If b2 = 4ac, then roots are real and both roots are same.
5:Prime Numbers: Sieve of Eratosthenes :generate prime numbers up to a given number N
6:Factorials
7:Permutation And Combination
8: Modular Arithmetic.
