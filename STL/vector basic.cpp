/*Some important and commonly used functions of Vector class are:
begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector.
size() – Returns the number of elements in the vector.
capacity() – Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated to the vector expressed as number of elements.
empty() – Returns whether the container is empty.
push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back.
pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position.
erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type and size.
clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container.
emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position.
emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector.
advance() :- This function is used to increment the iterator position till the specified number mentioned in its arguments
